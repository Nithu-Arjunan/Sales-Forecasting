Project involves sales forecasting using algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost and LSTM models.

Steps involved :
Importing the dataset to the python environment.
Examining the shape and structure of the dataset and checking for outliers.
Performing exploratory data analysis to better understand the data.
Building and comparing linear regression,random forest and XGBoost for model predictions.
Using the best performing model to make a forecast for the next year.
Building a Long short term memory for predictions.
calculating the mean absolute percentage error to comment on the models performance.
